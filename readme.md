# VIM Practice Games

Welcome to VIM Practice Games! This application aims to help users improve their skills with VIM editor movements through a series of fun and engaging games.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for users to practice and enhance their VIM editor skills in a playful and interactive way. The application currently includes a "Target Game" where players navigate to targets using VIM-like commands.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Application:** Run the application to start the VIM Practice Games.
2. **Main Menu:** Select the game you want to play. Currently, "Target Game" is available.
3. **Target Game:**
   - Use the following commands to move the Cursor (`X`) to the target (`T`):
     - `h` to move left
     - `j` to move down
     - `k` to move up
     - `l` to move right
   - Press `X` when you reach the target to score a point.
   - The game ends when you score 10 points.
4. **Exit:** Choose the exit option from the main menu to close the application.

## Future Enhancements

We plan to add more practice sections in the future, providing a broader range of VIM command practice opportunities.
